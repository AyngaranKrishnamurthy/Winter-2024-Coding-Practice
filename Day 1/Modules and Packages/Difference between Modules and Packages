1. A module is a single Python file containing code, while a package is a collection of related modules organized in a directory.

2. A module allows you to define functions, classes, and variables in one file, whereas a package helps manage large codebases by grouping multiple modules.

3. A module is imported using import module_name, but a package is imported using import package_name.module_name.

4. A module does not require any special files, while a package typically contains an __init__.py file to indicate it is a package (though in modern Python, it can be empty or omitted).

5. A module is ideal for small, single-purpose code, while a package provides better organization for larger projects with multiple modules working together.
