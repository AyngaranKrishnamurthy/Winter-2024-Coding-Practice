## What is Numpy?

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

### Limitations:
* Numpy arrays are of fixed size at creation and cannot be changed. When the size of a numpy array is changed, it'll create anew numpy array and delete the original array
* All elements present in a Numpy array should be of same datatype
