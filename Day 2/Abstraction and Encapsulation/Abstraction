Abstraction is the process of hiding the internal implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary functionality. 
The goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity by providing a simplified interface and hiding the underlying implementation that may be unnecessary for the user.

Two ways of Abstraction: 1. Abstract Classes, 2. Abstract Methods

Key Concepts of Abstraction:

Abstract Classes: These are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own. They are meant to be inherited by other classes. 
Abstract classes can contain both abstract methods (which don't have an implementation) and regular methods (which have a complete implementation).

Abstract Methods: These are methods that are declared in an abstract class but do not have any implementation. S
ubclasses that inherit from the abstract class must implement these methods.
