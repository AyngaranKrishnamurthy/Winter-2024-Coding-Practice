Design patterns in Python are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. They provide templates for solving issues in a flexible, scalable, and maintainable way. There are three main types of design patterns:

Creational Patterns: Concerned with the process of object creation.
Structural Patterns: Focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
Behavioral Patterns: Deal with how objects interact and communicate with one another.

1. Creational Patterns:

    Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance.
    Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of object that will be created.
    Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    Builder: Allows for constructing complex objects step by step, separating the construction process from the actual object representation.

2. Structural Patterns:

    Adapter: Converts one interface to another, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.
    Decorator: Dynamically adds behavior to an object at runtime without affecting its behavior in other contexts.
    Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem of classes, making it easier to use.

3. Behavioral Patterns:

    Observer: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
    Strategy: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable, allowing the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
    Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization, queuing, and logging of requests, and providing undo functionality.
